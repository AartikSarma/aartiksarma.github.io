Welcome to your new Jekyll site! This is your first blog post.

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website.

## Getting Started

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter.

## Next Steps

- Customize your site by editing `_config.yml`
- Add more posts in the `_posts` directory
- Modify the design by creating custom layouts in `_layouts`
- Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info
